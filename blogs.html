    <h1>Start the Day Off Right</h1>
    <p>
        If hectic mornings mean you're swinging by fast-food chains for breakfast, long lines in the drive-throughs show you're far from alone. Though a convenient meal out may not be as healthy or cheap as breakfast can be at home, it doesn't have to be a nutritional disaster. We consulted with dietitians and nutritionists to discover healthier alternatives to some of the most indulgent, unhealthy breakfast menu items at 10 popular chains

<h2>StarBuckz</h2>

<p>A steaming Caramel Brulée Latte from Starbucks is a tempting way to indulge your sweet tooth and get a nice jolt of caffeine, and an Almond Croissant seems like a natural choice to round out your breakfast. But beware: "With 450 calories and 47 grams of sugar, the Caramel Brulée Latte is more of a full out meal than a cup of coffee," warns Lauren Harris-Pincus, a registered dietitian who specializes in managing weight and prediabetes. "An Almond Croissant, while tasty, packs 420 calories and a whopping 22 grams of fat, which equals 34 percent of the recommended daily intake of fat in one croissant."</p>
<p>Tear yourself away from the bakery items, Harris-Pincus recommends. "I'm in love with the Spinach, Feta and Cage Free Egg White Breakfast Wrap because it's a mix of protein, veggies and whole grains. For 290 calories, you get 19 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber." Pairing it with a Tall Skinny Latte tacks on only 100 calories and a more reasonable 14 grams of sugar.

    <h2>Micky D</h2>
    <p>Got a big appetite? It might be tempting to dig into McDonald's Big Breakfast with Hotcakes, which also includes scrambled eggs, a biscuit, hash browns, and sausage. But your big morning indulgence "is a horrific meal nutritionally in every sense," says Jennifer Glockner, a registered dietitian nutritionist and creator of Smartee Plate. The calorie count is almost three-fourths of what a person on a 2,000-calorie diet needs in a day, she says, and the 25 grams of artery-clogging saturated fat is actually over daily guidelines. Also hiding in this meal: Close to a day's worth of sodium and sugar.
    </p>
    <p>Instead, Glockner suggests digging into an Egg White Delight McMuffin, made with grilled egg whites, extra-lean Canadian bacon and white cheddar. With this meal, you're down to 7 grams of saturated fat. For a little bit of sweetness, add a yogurt parfait, which will "have added sugars, but not to the level of the big breakfast of hotcakes," she says. An even healthier choice, she says: Snag some apple slices in place of the parfait.</p>
